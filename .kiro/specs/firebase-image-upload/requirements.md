# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Firebase Storage into the portfolio website to enable dynamic image uploads for project showcases. The system will allow uploading, storing, and displaying project images with proper management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an image file THEN the system SHALL upload it to Firebase Storage
2. WHEN the upload is complete THEN the system SHALL return a downloadable URL
3. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL validate file type (jpg, png, webp)
4. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL limit file size to 5MB maximum
5. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want to replace placeholder images with real project screenshots, so that visitors can see actual project visuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a project image THEN the system SHALL store it with a unique filename

3. WHEN displaying projects THEN the system SHALL show the uploaded images instead of placeholders
4. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a fallback placeholder

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want an admin interface to manage project images, so that I can easily add, update, or remove project visuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin interface THEN the system SHALL show all current projects with their images
2. WHEN I click on a project image THEN the system SHALL allow me to upload a replacement
3. WHEN I upload a new image THEN the system SHALL delete the old image from Firebase Storage
4. WHEN I save changes THEN the system SHALL persist the updated project data
5. IF I don't have admin permissions THEN the system SHALL hide the upload interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see high-quality project images that load quickly, so that I can properly evaluate the portfolio work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the work page THEN images SHALL load with proper optimization
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain aspect ratio and quality
3. WHEN hovering over project cards THEN images SHALL show smooth transitions
4. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
5. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a professional fallback image
